# ST-CGAN: Stacked Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Jointly Learning Shadow Detection and Shadow Removal with PyTorch

This repository is unofficial implementation of  [Stacked Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Jointly Learning Shadow Detection and Shadow Removal](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02478) [Wang+, **CVPR** 2018] with PyTorch.

**Official Dataset and Code(coming soon...) is [here](https://github.com/DeepInsight-PCALab/ST-CGAN).**

## Requirements
* Python3.x
* PyTorch 1.5.0
* pillow
* matplotlib

## Usage
* Set datasets under ```./dataset```. You can Download datasets from [here](https://github.com/DeepInsight-PCALab/ST-CGAN). 

Then,
### Training
```
python3 train.py
```
### Testing
When Testing images from ISTD dataset.
```
python3 test.py -l <checkpoint number>
```
When you would like to test your own image.
```
python3 test.py -l <checkpoint number> -i <image_path> -o <out_path>
```


## Results
Here is a result from test sets.
