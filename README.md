# Shadow Sight

Shadow Detection and removal is the process of enhance the computer vision applications including image segmentation, object recognition, object tracking etc. Detection and Removal of shadow from the images and videos can reduce the undesirable outcomes in the computer vision applications and algorithms. 

* ShadowSight uses Stacked Conditional GANs trained on ISTD and implemented unofficially in [this project](https://github.com/IsHYuhi/ST-CGAN_Stacked_Conditional_Generative_Adversarial_Networks). 

* This project gives the service of shadow detection and removal in the form of a Flask application

## Requirements
* Flask
* Python3.x
* PyTorch 1.5.0
* pillow
* matplotlib

## Run 

Run `app.py` to start the application locally. You can make changes to parameters inside the scripts as needed.

## Some Implementation Details from the ST-CGAN project

### Usage
* Set datasets under ```./dataset```. You can Download datasets from [here](https://github.com/DeepInsight-PCALab/ST-CGAN). 

Then,
#### Training
```
python3 train.py
```
#### Testing
When Testing images from ISTD dataset.
```
python3 test.py -l <checkpoint number>
```
When you would like to test your own image.
```
python3 test.py -l <checkpoint number> -i <image_path> -o <out_path>
```
